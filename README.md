## Fork of [Signal Android](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android), with an implementation of an interactive map like the Snapchat one.

Signal is a simple, powerful, open-source and secure messenger.

My goal with this fork is to implement an interactive map like the Snapchat one on a new tab in the Android app.
I'm hesitating to implement zood location sharing instead of building a new location sharing system.

**What I want this feature to be able to do :**

- Display on a map the location of contacts
- Share your location with your contacts
- Manage who can see your location
- Manage the visibility of people that decided share you theirs with you
